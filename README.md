## - Create a kanban board with the following data, fill it and keep it updated:
  - Name of Feature
  - Feature Owner (who will write it?)
  - Estimated time it would take (in hours, **don't overthink it**)
  - Actual time it took (in hours)
  - Estimated time it would take to unit test (in hours)
  - Actual time it took to unit test (in hours)
- For the board you could use Trello or GitLab's project system.
  - If your selected tool does not support time estimation (for example Trello), 
  just write it in the card's description or use an addon.
Try to adhere to this project specification and make your project as close to it as possible. 
As you implement each feature, write down the time it really took you and compare them with the estimate. 
Do not be surprised if the difference between them is great, that's completely normal when you do something like this
for the first time. Also, don't go crazy on features, implement a few but implement them amazingly!

## Must Requirements

**The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so take it seriously and be honest.**
